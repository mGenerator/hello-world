Hello World repository for Git tutorial. This is an example repository for the Git tutorial on https://www.w3schools.com. This repository loosely follows the tutorial. Supercalifragilisticespialidotious!
Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. 
But if I had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate, 
To say that for destruction ice, is twice as great and would suffice.

Or would it really? I do wonder, what if water were to wain?
